Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Guidelines

Definition:
Diabetic Retinopathy is a diabetes complication caused by damage to the blood vessels of the retina. It is a leading cause of vision impairment.

Stages of DR:
1. No Diabetic Retinopathy – No signs of damage.
2. Mild Non-Proliferative DR – Microaneurysms present.
3. Moderate Non-Proliferative DR – Increased microaneurysms, hemorrhages.
4. Severe Non-Proliferative DR – Blocked blood supply to retina.
5. Proliferative DR – New abnormal blood vessels grow, leading to vision loss risk.

Symptoms:
- Blurred vision
- Dark spots or floaters
- Difficulty seeing at night
- Sudden vision loss in advanced stages

Risk Factors:
- Poor blood sugar control
- Long duration of diabetes
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Pregnancy

Screening Recommendations:
- Type 1 Diabetes: First exam within 5 years of diagnosis, then annually.
- Type 2 Diabetes: Eye exam at diagnosis, then annually.
- Pregnant women with diabetes: Eye exam before pregnancy or in first trimester.

Treatment Options:
- Laser photocoagulation to seal leaking vessels
- Anti-VEGF injections to reduce abnormal vessel growth
- Vitrectomy surgery for advanced bleeding in the eye
- Strict blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol control

Prevention:
- Maintain good glycemic control (HbA1c < 7%)
- Manage blood pressure (< 130/80 mmHg)
- Keep cholesterol within target range
- Regular eye screening

Emergency Signs (Seek immediate care):
- Sudden loss of vision
- Large floaters or flashes of light
- Severe eye pain
